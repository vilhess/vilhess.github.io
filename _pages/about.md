I am currently pursuing a Ph.D at the LITIS Lab, INSA Rouen, with a research focus on time series for anomaly detection, forecasting and the development of foundation models. I have a strong background in Mathematics, with a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from Paris-Saclay University and a Master's degree in Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence from the same institution.

* 10-2025 - Participated in the [F√™te de la Science de Rouen 2025](https://www.fetedelascience.fr/village-des-sciences-de-rouen-le-madrillet-2025) 
where I developed an interactive game that challenges players to predict future signal values and compete against a zero-shot forecasting model I designed: [PatchFM](https://github.com/vilhess/PatchFM). The objective is simple ‚Äî beat the model by making more accurate predictions.
The game code is available [here](https://github.com/vilhess/PatchFM-FDS25).

* 09-2025 - Participated in the [EUSIPCO 2025](https://eusipco2025.org) conference presenting my paper PatchTrAD in a 15-minute talk.
The slides can be found [here](https://github.com/vilhess/PatchTrAD/tree/main/files/presentation.pdf).

* 07-2025 - Participated in the [Hi! Paris Summer School 2025](https://www.hi-paris.fr) presenting my paper PatchTrAD in a poster session.
The poster can be found [here](https://github.com/vilhess/PatchTrAD/tree/main/files/poster.pdf).

* 05-2025 - [PatchTrAD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08827) has been accepted at EUSIPCO 2025.

Me, Myself & Maths üî¢
======

I am passionate about Artificial Intelligence. In my spare time, I enjoy building state-of-the-art Machine Learning models and exploring the mathematical theories behind them. One of my favorite architectures is the Variational Autoencoder, introduced in the paper [Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114). I‚Äôm particularly drawn to VAEs because they elegantly combine Bayesian inference with deep learning. Working on a project involving this architecture was a turning point, it sparked my desire to pursue a Ph.D, further reinforced by the professional experience I gained during my internships. In addition, I enjoy sharing my knowledge and passion for mathematics by working as a tutor for students. 

# Favourite Papers üìù

1. [Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114)  
   Obviously, it holds the first position. 

2. [Neural Tangent Kernel: Convergence and Generalization in Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07572)  
   Infinitely wide neural networks behave like kernel regression, and their training dynamics can be analyzed through their corresponding kernels. I appreciate this paper because it provides a solid theoretical foundation for wide neural networks, supported by extensive mathematics.

3. [PatchTST: A Time Series is Worth 64 Words: Long-term Forecasting with Transformers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.14730)  
   This paper proposes a powerful Transformer architecture for time series forecasting by dividing sequences into patches, analogous to tokens in LLMs. Following its publication, the patch-based paradigm gained significant attention in time series modeling. This approach enables training time series models with architectures closely aligned to those used in LLMs.

4. [Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239)  
   I really appreciate this paper; the Bayesian inference theory underpinning diffusion models is both fascinating and enjoyable to understand.

5. [Regularized Evolution for Image Classifier Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01548)  
   I was torn between this paper and the original Transformer paper. This paper employs a simple evolutionary algorithm to discover highly effective architectures for image classification. The underlying intuition is straightforward, yet it proves to be an incredibly powerful strategy.

Sports üö¥üèº
======
The main sport I pursued as a teenager was cycling, and I participated in numerous national races during my teenage years. I won several department and regional races, including being crowned Department Champion once and [Regional Team Champion](https://www.facebook.com/573518262704708/photos/vilhes-se-r%C3%A9v%C3%A8lesamy-vilhes-vous-connaissiez-comme-beaucoup-vous-avez-appris-%C3%A0-l/998631540193376/) once.
When I stopped cycling, I transitioned to streetlifting, a strength sport focused on muscle-ups, pull-ups, dips, and squats. I have competed twice in the French Dips Championship and I have been the [First Step French Champion of Streetlifting in 2024](https://www.instagram.com/p/C4iBlPwo76L/?img_index=5) in the -80 kg category. I have also worked as a trainer, helping athletes reach higher levels by providing them with tailored programs and weekly progress tracking.
