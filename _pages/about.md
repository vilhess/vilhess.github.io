I am currently pursuing a PhD at the LITIS Lab, INSA Rouen, with a research focus on Time Series Anomaly Detection. I have a strong background in Mathematics, with a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from Paris-Saclay University and a Master's degree in Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence from the same institution.

Me, Myself & Maths
======

I am passionate about Artificial Intelligence. In my spare time, I enjoy building state-of-the-art Machine Learning models and exploring the mathematical theories behind them. One of my favorite architectures is the Variational Autoencoder, introduced in the paper [Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114). I love this architecture because VAEs combine Bayesian Inference with Deep Learning.It was a project involving this architecture that inspired me to pursue a PhD, alongside the professional experience I gained during my internships. In addition, I enjoy sharing my knowledge and passion for mathematics by working as a tutor for students. 

# Favourite Papers

1. [Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114)  
   Obviously, it holds the first position. Without it, I am nothing, and because of it, I am everything.

2. [Neural Tangent Kernel: Convergence and Generalization in Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07572)  
   Infinitely wide neural networks behave like kernel regression, and their training dynamics can be analyzed through their corresponding kernels. I appreciate this paper because it provides a solid theoretical foundation for wide neural networks, supported by extensive mathematics.

3. [Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239)  
   I really appreciate this paper; the Bayesian inference theory underpinning diffusion models is both fascinating and enjoyable to understand.

4. [Regularized Evolution for Image Classifier Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01548)  
   This paper employs a simple evolutionary algorithm to discover highly effective architectures for image classification. The underlying intuition is straightforward, yet it proves to be an incredibly powerful strategy.

5. [U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597)  
   I was torn between this paper and the original Transformer paper, but since the U-Net was one of the first architectures I worked with, I ranked it in 5th position.

Sports
======
The main sport I pursued as a teenager was cycling, and I participated in numerous national races during my teenage years. I won several department and regional races, including being crowned Department Champion once and [Regional Team Champion](https://www.facebook.com/573518262704708/photos/vilhes-se-r%C3%A9v%C3%A8lesamy-vilhes-vous-connaissiez-comme-beaucoup-vous-avez-appris-%C3%A0-l/998631540193376/) once.
When I stopped cycling, I transitioned to streetlifting, a strength sport focused on muscle-ups, pull-ups, dips, and squats. I have competed twice in the French Dips Championship and I have been the (First Step French Champion of Streetlifting in 2024)[https://www.instagram.com/p/C4iBlPwo76L/?img_index=5] in the -80 kg category. I have also worked as a trainer, helping athletes reach higher levels by providing them with tailored programs and weekly progress tracking.
