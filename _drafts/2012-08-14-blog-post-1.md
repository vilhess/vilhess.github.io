If you're curious about the mathematics behind Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), check out this detailed cheat sheet: [document](https://vilhess.github.io/files/rnn.pdf). It provides an insightful breakdown of the concepts and equations driving these popular neural network architectures.

For those eager to dive into the code, Iâ€™ve implemented basic and convolutional versions of both LSTM and GRU using PyTorch. You can explore the implementations on my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/vilhess/codes/tree/main/rnn). Whether you're a researcher or developer, this repo is a great starting point to learn and experiment with RNNs in PyTorch!
