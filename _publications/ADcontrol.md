This paper summarizes the initial stages of my thesis research. We focus in a first step on anomaly detection algorithms for image data. 
I explore various techniques and incorporate a thresholding procedure utilizing p-values, inspired by the work presented in [Testing for Outliers with Conformal p-values](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08279).
